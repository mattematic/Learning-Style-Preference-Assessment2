Learning Style Preference Assessment
Instructions
Rate each statement on a scale of 1-5 based on how well it describes you: 1 = Strongly Disagree 2 = Disagree 3 = Neutral 4 = Agree 5 = Strongly Agree
Part 1: Sensory Preferences
Visual
I prefer to see information written down.
I easily remember faces but forget names.
I use color-coding to organize information.
Diagrams and charts help me understand complex ideas.
I can easily visualize objects, plans, and outcomes in my mind.
Auditory
I prefer verbal instructions over written ones.
I enjoy discussing ideas and concepts with others.
I remember information better when I say it aloud.
Background sounds or music help me concentrate.
I find it easier to follow a spoken lecture than reading material.
Reading/Writing
I take detailed notes when learning something new.
I prefer to read about a concept rather than have someone explain it.
I organize my thoughts by writing them down.
I enjoy creating written lists, outlines, and summaries.
I prefer text-based learning materials over videos or demonstrations.
Kinesthetic
I prefer hands-on activities over lectures.
I tend to use gestures and hand movements when speaking.
I become restless during long periods of inactivity.
I learn best when I can physically practice a skill.
I prefer to try things out rather than read instructions.
Part 2: Cognitive Approach
Deep Learning
I seek to understand the underlying principles behind what I'm learning.
I naturally look for connections between different subjects.
I question assumptions and look for evidence before accepting ideas.
I enjoy exploring complex problems and concepts.
I prefer open-ended questions over memorization tasks.
Strategic Learning
I adapt my study approach based on what's being assessed.
I'm good at managing my time and prioritizing tasks.
I focus more energy on content that will be evaluated.
I plan my approach before starting a learning task.
I set clear goals for what I want to accomplish when studying.
Scoring Guide
Add your scores for each category:
Visual (questions 1-5): _____
Auditory (questions 6-10): _____
Reading/Writing (questions 11-15): _____
Kinesthetic (questions 16-20): _____
Deep Learning (questions 21-25): _____
Strategic Learning (questions 26-30): _____
Your highest score(s) indicate your primary learning style preference(s). Most people have a mix of preferences rather than a single dominant style.
Learning Recommendations Based on Your Style
Now that I've created the assessment, here are tailored recommendations for each learning preference:
For Visual Learners:
Mind mapping - Create visual diagrams connecting related concepts
Color-coding - Use different colors for notes, categories, and important points
Flashcards - Create visual study aids with diagrams or symbols
Visualization - Picture concepts in your mind before tests
Graphic organizers - Use charts, timelines, and diagrams to organize information
For Auditory Learners:
Recorded lectures - Record and replay important information
Study groups - Discuss concepts verbally with peers
Self-explanation - Teach concepts aloud to yourself or others
Audio resources - Use audiobooks and podcasts
Verbal repetition - Recite important information aloud
For Reading/Writing Learners:
Detailed notes - Rewrite notes in your own words
Outlines - Create hierarchical structures of information
Written summaries - Condense key points after studying
Text-heavy resources - Seek out articles and books on topics
Writing practice - Create sample questions and answers
For Kinesthetic Learners:
Hands-on experiments - Create physical models or demonstrations
Movement while studying - Walk or move while reviewing material
Role-playing - Act out scenarios or processes
Real-world application - Find practical ways to apply concepts
Study breaks - Take short, active breaks between study sessions
For Deep Learners:
Concept mapping - Create diagrams showing relationships between ideas
Socratic questioning - Ask probing questions about the material
Interdisciplinary connections - Link new information to other subjects
Case studies - Examine real-world examples of theoretical concepts
Teaching others - Explain concepts to deepen your understanding
For Strategic Learners:
Practice tests - Create and take sample assessments
Time management tools - Break studying into scheduled sessions
Prioritization - Focus on high-value content first
Goal-setting - Establish clear learning objectives
Self-assessment - Regularly evaluate your understanding
Remember that using techniques from multiple learning preferences often leads to better outcomes than relying solely on your dominant style. Would you like me to expand on any specific learning techniques or add additional categories to the assessment?
